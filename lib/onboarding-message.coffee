Hello, and welcome to Data for Democracy's Slack workspace! This is where we \
all hang out, collaborate, and discuss how we can use data and technology to \
make positive changes in communities around the world.

Please take a moment to review our *Code of Conduct* here:
https://github.com/Data4Democracy/read-this-first/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md

Before you jump in, we'd also love for you to sign our *Global Data Ethics \
Pledge*. The Pledge is a sort of Hippocratic Oath, but for data workers \
instead of medical practitioners. To learn more, visit \
https://www.datafordemocracy.org/pledge.

_*Introduce yourself!*_
We love meeting new people. Head over to #onboarding and tell us a little \
about yourself. Things that are great to include are the types of projects you \
are interested in working on and any relevant technology experience you have. \
Don't be intimidated if you're just getting started -- there are always \
plenty of non-technical roles to fill!

_*Ready to help out with one of our ongoing projects?*_
Our most active projects are listed near the top of our GitHub home page at \
https://github.com/Data4Democracy. You'll find more information on how to get \
started inside each project's repository. Once you've found one to pique your \
interest, head over to its corresponding Slack channel and ask about ways to \
get involved!

_*Want to start your own project?*_
Full documentation on starting a project and becoming a project lead can be \
found at https://github.com/Data4Democracy/project-ideas. You can also pitch \
your idea in #project-ideas to get feedback from the community!

In the meantime our friendly bot, Data, is always around and here to help! \
Message @Data with 'help' to see a list of all the things it can do for you.
